# Key Java formal verification fork

So that it will be on GitHub, I have no relation to the project. Origin <http://www.key-project.org/>.

Quickstart:

    cd system
    make

Start the GUI:

    cd ../bin
    ./key



I have already embedded the required Jars in this repository, as provided at <http://www.key-project.org/download/libraries.html> It's ugly, but does the trick until those academics decide to use Maven =)
